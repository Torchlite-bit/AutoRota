# Aegis_SBR — Architecture & Conventions

How the addon is put together, and the conventions to follow. Read this before working in
an area you haven't touched. (File names below reflect the pre-rebrand state; the core file
becomes `Aegis_SBR.lua` after Phase 0. Update this doc as part of the rebrand.)

## File layout (load order matters — set by the .toc)
- **Core / shell**: `Aegis_SBR.lua` (was `AutoRota.lua`) — the engine tick, event frame,
  slash handling, profile management, saved-variables, shared helpers
  (`EnsureAutoAttack`, `InMeleeRange`, `KnowsSpell`, `ScanTargetDebuff`, `Queue`, etc.),
  the class-module dispatch.
- **Shared UI framework**: `AutoRota_UI.lua` → (`Aegis_SBR_UI.lua`) — the config window,
  theme/palette, all UI primitives (see below), the scroll system, header/footer, profile
  pill, spec tab rails.
- **Minimap**: `AutoRota_Minimap.lua` → button + options.
- **Per-class rotation modules**: `Class_<Name>.lua` (Warrior, Paladin, Hunter, Rogue,
  Priest, Shaman, Mage, Warlock, Druid) — the priority lists + class helpers.
- **Per-class UI panels**: `Class_<Name>_UI.lua` — the config panel for that class.
- **Assets**: `Icons/` (TGA textures — toggles, sliders, buttons, pills, cards, sigil, and
  the new `logo`), `Fonts/` (PT Sans Narrow, OFL-licensed + `OFL.txt`).
- **Meta**: `.toc`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/`, `scripts/verify.py`,
  `docs/TALENTS_1.18.1.md` (talent name reference used by the modules).

## Rotation model
- Each class module exposes `M:Rotate(cfg)` (and spec sub-rotations). On each press the
  engine calls into the active module; the priority list is evaluated top-down; the FIRST
  ability whose gate passes is cast and the function RETURNS (strict single-cast, no GCD
  clipping). Gates check: known/learned, cooldown ready, resource floor, range, stance/form,
  debuff/proc windows, and the user's per-ability toggles.
- Casting primitives: `Cast(name)` (reports success if merely KNOWN — see the caveat in the
  Warrior module header), `Queue(name)` (uses Nampower queueing), `Try(name)` /
  `CanCast(name, cost, stances)` wrappers in some modules.
- Heal engines: four near-identical copies live in the healer modules
  (Paladin/Priest/Druid/Shaman) — slated for dedupe (roadmap Phase 2). Touch with care;
  changing one usually means changing all four until deduped.

## UI primitives (in the shared UI file)
- **`Row`** — the single-row layout: `[toggle] label [sub] ......... [slider] [value]` with
  hairline separators. Every class panel is built from `Row`. Uniform slider column;
  when a spell isn't learned, the row hides its slider and gives the label full width. Read
  the `Row` implementation before changing panel layout — it's shared by all 9 classes.
- **`BindCheck(item, on, spellName)`** — binds a toggle to config + appends "(not learned)"
  and greys/hides the slider when the spell is untrained. Central to every panel refresh.
- **`Dropdown`** — full-width picker with a fixed label column (boxes align across rows),
  centered box text, ink label color.
- **`SkinButton` / `SkinClose`** — rounded button/close art (layered TGA for a 1px rounded
  border; accent = filled).
- **Section cards** via `NineSlice` on `Card.tga`; **spec tab rails** via
  `BuildSpecTabs`/`SelectSpecTab` (Reflow shows only the active spec's sections);
  boolean-bound rails (Paladin Damage|Healer) use encode/decode hooks.
- **Scroll system**: `MakeScroll` + `UpdateScrollRange` — the bar hides unless overflow
  exceeds the bottom pad; the thumb is a small fixed grip inset in a full-span groove so it
  never overhangs (a hard-won 1.12 slider fix — don't revert to a proportional thumb).

## Events (core event frame)
- `ADDON_LOADED` (init + the Phase 0 DB migration), `PLAYER_LOGIN`, `SPELLS_CHANGED`
  (invalidate spell index + validity cache), `CHAT_MSG_COMBAT_SELF_HITS/MISSES` (swing
  tracking), `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`, and **`UNIT_CASTEVENT`** (SuperWoW; resolved via
  `SpellInfo(arg4)` and dispatched to the active module's `OnCastEvent` if it defines one —
  currently Shaman totem tracking).
- **Before writing casting/detection code, read `docs/dependencies.md`** — the actual
  SuperWoW / Nampower / SuperCleveRoidMacros APIs, events, and limits (e.g. Nampower's
  one-GCD-queued / one-non-GCD-per-tick constraints, GUID hex-string handling).

## Conventions
- **Lua 5.0 only** — see CLAUDE.md Hard Constraints (`table.getn`, `math.mod`, no
  `string.match`, event globals `arg1…`).
- **Define before use** within each file (single-pass loader). The ordering audit in
  `verify.py` enforces this per file; cross-file order is the `.toc` order — keep it stable.
- **Comments explain WHY.** Match the existing flat-dark palette and naming.
- **Textures**: power-of-two TGA, referenced without extension, double backslashes; new/
  renamed textures need a full relog.
- **Versioning**: letter-suffix (e.g. `0.13.12b`); bump `.toc` + core `.lua` `ver` + README
  H1 together and prepend a `CHANGELOG.md` entry; grep to confirm no stale version strings.
- **Profiles**: `NormalizeProfile` fills MISSING keys only (never clobbers user values) — so
  adding a config field is backward-safe. Templates per spec provide sensible defaults.

## Verifier (scripts/verify.py)
- `python3 scripts/verify.py --all` after every edit: balance check + define-before-use
  ordering audit over all `.lua`. Non-zero exit on failure (can gate a commit hook).
- It's a heuristic static check, not a Lua parser — it catches the common silent-load-crash
  classes but not semantic errors. Always still test in-game.
