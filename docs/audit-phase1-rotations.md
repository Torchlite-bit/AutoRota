## 1. PALADIN (`classes/Class_Paladin.lua`)

### What the code does

**Damage/tank mode** (strict single-cast, per press): `0` pre-cast opener seal while out of
melee range (never judges out of range) → `1` shared-CD strike (see ladders below) → `2`
Holy Shield when its own CD is free (held through the GCD) → `2b` Consecration on CD when
the AoE toggle is on (skipped during mana recovery) → `3` seal upkeep + Judgement
(`HandleSeals`) → `4` Hammer of Wrath at target ≤20% → `5` Repentance on CD → `6` Exorcism
vs Undead/Demon (skipped during mana recovery).

Strike ladders (both-strikes-on): **autodps** — without *Vengeful Strikes*: Crusader Strike
until Zeal at **3 stacks** and topped (renew <12s), else Holy Strike; with the talent: Holy
Strike to open/keep *Holy Might* (renew <7s), CS to ramp/hold Zeal at **3**, Zeal wins
ties, Holy Strike is the filler. **tankblock** — CS whenever the *Zealous Defense* block
buff is missing, else Holy Strike (threat). Seal logic: debuff seal judged once per target
(GUID-tracked with a 1.5s detection-dropout memory), then the damage seal is judged on CD
with reseal; optional seal-twist holds the judge until <0.4s before the next white swing;
Seal of Wisdom / Seal of Light hysteresis overrides for mana/HP management.

**Heal mode**: Blessed-Strikes CS weave to reload Holy Shock (never while anyone is under
the emergency line) → targeted heal (`DoHeal`: worst-hurt reachable member; Holy Shock for
emergencies or out-of-range; else downranked Flash of Light vs Holy Light by
least-overheal, with cast-time and Mortal-Strike-debuff compensation) → with nobody hurt:
Holy Strike splash filler (own mana floor) → Seal of Wisdom self-upkeep + optional
Judgement of Wisdom stamp.

### Discrepancies

| # | Ability / order | What the code does | What research says | Source + confidence | Recommended action | RISK if changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | **Zeal ramp target** | Ramps Crusader Strike to **3 stacks** of Zeal (`ZEAL_STACKS = 3`), renews when <12s | "ramp **Crusader Strike to 5 stacks of Zeal**" | rotations.md Ret `[T]` section — but the stack cap itself is a checkable number → treat as **[?]** | **Verify in-game first**: `/sbr debug` shows live buff stacks. If Zeal really caps at 5, raise `ZEAL_STACKS` (1-line change, gated) | If Zeal actually caps at 3 and we "fix" to 5, the ramp never completes → CS forever, Holy Might starves. If it caps at 5 and we stay at 3, we leave stacks on the table. Cheap to verify, do not change on paper |
| P2 | **Judgement vs strike order** | Strike is priority 1, Judgement (inside seal handling) is priority 3 | Ret: "Judgement on CD" listed **before** strikes | rotations.md Ret `[T]` | Probably **no change**: the module header says strikes queue on the next swing (on-next-swing = no GCD contention), which would make the order moot. **Verify [?]**: if strikes DO eat a GCD on Turtle, the order matters and should be discussed | If strikes are on-next-swing, reordering changes nothing. If they are on-GCD, swapping delays the strike a press — measurable on a dummy either way |
| P3 | **Holy Strike vs Crusader emphasis (talented Ret)** | Buff-timer alternation: HS keeps Holy Might, CS keeps Zeal, HS fills | "**Holy Strike on CD** (mana-free, mana via JoW) → ramp CS to Zeal" — HS-first emphasis | rotations.md Ret `[T]` (but self-tensioned: HS "on CD" + CS ramp can't both happen on ONE shared 6s CD) | **No change without a dummy log.** The code's alternation is a *more precise* statement of the same intent; research's phrasing can't be implemented literally | Replacing timer-driven alternation with naive "HS on CD" would drop Zeal entirely — clear regression risk |
| P4 | **Consecration role** | AoE-only manual toggle, cast on CD when on; skipped in mana recovery | Ret: "Consecration if mana allows" (single-target filler, mana-gated); Prot: "high-rank Consecration" core | rotations.md `[T]` | **User decision**: current design is deliberate (no reliable enemy count on 1.12; README documents it). If wanted for ST, that's just "toggle stays on" — a doc note, not a code change | Auto-casting Consecration ST would burn mana in leveling/5-mans; the manual toggle is the safer default |
| P5 | **Prot: Holy Shield trigger** | Cast whenever its own CD is free (toggle on) | "Holy Shield **on Redoubt proc**" | rotations.md Prot `[T]` — interplay claim, **[?]** in practice | **Report + verify**: needs in-game confirmation that holding Holy Shield for Redoubt procs is a real Turtle interaction (charges/uptime math). Do not change on paper | Holding a defensive for a proc that isn't real = uptime loss on a TANK defensive — highest-risk change in this class; demands strong evidence |
| P6 | **Prot: Bulwark of the Righteous missing** | Not referenced anywhere in the module | Row-7 Prot capstone: "Holy damage + 40% DR, 3-min CD" — part of the tank rotation | rotations.md Prot `[T]` | **Gap, report**: if the user tanks with this talent, add as an opt-in toggle (new ability = rotation change → needs sign-off + exact spell name from the client) | Low risk to add as opt-in-default-off; wrong spell name just no-ops (KnowsSpell gate) |
| P7 | **Prot: which seal** | Template: debuff *Seal of the Crusader* + damage *Seal of Righteousness*; Wisdom only via mana-management hysteresis | Prot: "judge **Seal of Wisdom**, reseal" as the core loop (mana sustain) | rotations.md Prot `[T]` | **Config-level**: the engine already supports it (set Wisdom as debuff seal / mana-manage). At most change the `prot` TEMPLATE default — still gated since templates seed rotations | Template-only change; existing profiles unaffected (NormalizeProfile never overwrites) |
| P8 | **Seal-less white swings** | `sealTwist` (hold Judgement until <0.4s pre-swing) exists but defaults **off**; after a judge, the reseal happens next press → a white swing can land seal-less | "Judgement on CD (**respect swing timer; never white-swing seal-less**)" | rotations.md Ret `[T]` | **User decision**: flipping `sealTwist` default on (or defaulting it on in the retri template) matches research; it's already implemented | Twist ON can delay Judgement up to a swing — on slow weapons that postpones JoW/JoL uptime; hand-tuned default may be deliberate |
| P9 | **Heal mode: melee-as-healing philosophy** | Strikes only weave when **nobody is hurt** (Holy Strike splash filler) or to reload Holy Shock; targeted heals always preempt | Holy min-max: "MELEE the boss — Holy Strike (AoE group heal) + CS (reset Holy Shock). **>30% of endgame healing** can come from melee" — melee is a primary healing channel, not downtime filler | rotations.md Holy `[T]` | **Discuss**: an optional "aggressive melee-holy" mode (weave Holy Strike even with moderate group damage, e.g. above the emergency line) would match the research. Significant behavior change → per-class sign-off + in-game testing | Weaving strikes while people are hurt trades targeted-heal latency for splash volume; badly tuned it drops someone. The current conservative gate is defensible |
| P10 | **Heal mode: Daybreak not tracked** | No handling of the Daybreak crit-heal buff (12s +20% healing-taken/+5% max-HP) | Daybreak capstone called out for Holy | rotations.md Holy `[T]` | **Note only**: it's a passive proc on the TARGET; possible future use is target-preference while the buff runs. Not worth logic until tuning phase | — |
| P11 | **Leveling ladder leans CS** | Pre-talent autodps: CS to 3 Zeal first, HS only after | Leveling: "Seal of Command R1 + **Holy Strike** (free) + Judgement between autos" — HS-lean while leveling | rotations.md Leveling `[T]` | **User decision**: pre-talent HS-lean is arguable (HS is mana-free at low ranks? — verify mana costs); current CS-lean is the hand-tuned ExAutoCSHS heritage | Wrong lean while leveling costs little; verify Holy Strike's actual "free" claim (code's DOWNRANK table lists nonzero HS mana ceilings — research's "mana-free" may be Turtle-wrong or rank-1-only **[?]** |

### Match notes (checked, no discrepancy)

- Strikes share ONE cooldown — code models it exactly (`ResolveSharedCD`, one pick per
  window). Matches `[T]`.
- Blessed Strikes → Holy Shock reset weave is implemented (heal mode, talent-detected,
  never over an emergency). Matches `[T]`.
- Holy Shock is heal-only in code (never cast offensively). Matches the Turtle removal
  `[T]`.
- Hammer of Wrath ≤20% = standard execute gate; Exorcism restricted to Undead/Demon with
  creature-type check. Vanilla-correct `[V]`.
- Seal choice is user-config (SoR default in templates = research's preference). ✓
- Hand spells (BoP/Freedom/Sacrifice) are Phase 4 scope — correctly absent today.

## 2. HUNTER (`classes/Class_Hunter.lua`)

### What the code does

Mode = ranged / melee / auto (auto picks by ~10yd `CheckInteractDistance` with 0.75s
stickiness). Off-GCD layer each press: pet attack / smart Growl / AoE Thunderstomp, burst
CDs (Rapid Fire + Bestial Wrath, always/elite/off), Kill Command on CD, Baited Shot in the
4s pet-crit window. Then strict GCD priority: `1` aspect upkeep (mana-aspect hysteresis
overrides Wolf/Hawk) → `2` **Hunter's Mark strict opener** (nothing proceeds until
confirmed) → `3` optional Aimed opener (pre-pull only) → `4` Auto Shot upkeep (ranged;
event-timed with stall restart) / melee swing start → `5a` sting upkeep (ranged-distance
only, Nampower-queued, immunity learning per target, queue-hold so lower shots can't evict
it) → `5b` Mend Pet → `5c` **Aimed Shot on Lock-and-Load proc** → `5d` Immolation Trap on
CD → melee branch: Carve (AoE lead) → Mongoose Bite (5s dodge window) → Lacerate upkeep →
Raptor Strike → Wing Clip; ranged branch: AoE (Multi-Shot → Volley) → **Steady Shot woven
1:1 in the post-Auto-Shot window** (event-timed, never clips) → Multi-Shot ST → Arcane
finisher ≤30% target HP → Arcane filler (≥50% mana or while Auto Shot is stale/moving) →
Aimed on CD only when both proc-guard and opener mode are off.

### Discrepancies

| # | Ability / order | What the code does | What research says | Source + confidence | Recommended action | RISK if changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | **Serpent Sting icon fallback (the known bug)** | Every sting/Mark detection is `TargetDebuffUp(name, nil)` — **no icon-fragment fallback**. If SuperWoW's id→name path misses (or no SuperWoW), the debuff always reads "not up" and the sting is blind-recast every throttle interval — wasted casts + debuff-slot churn | rotations.md flags it: "Known bug (Phase 1): Serpent Sting icon fallback" | rotations.md Hunter, explicit | **Fix now (pre-authorized by roadmap as a non-priority display/detection fix)**: pass the classic icon fragments as fallback (Serpent=`Ability_Hunter_Quickshot`, Scorpid=`Ability_Hunter_CriticalShot`, Viper=`Ability_Hunter_AimedShot`, Mark=`Ability_Hunter_SniperShot`). No priority change; SuperWoW clients unaffected (name path still wins) | Fragment collision with another debuff icon could false-positive "up" — fragments chosen are the stings' own 1.12 icons; name match still takes precedence |
| H2 | **AoE: Explosive Trap missing** | AoE = Carve (melee) / Multi-Shot → Volley (ranged) + Immolation Trap on CD. No Explosive Trap anywhere | Survival AoE = "**Carve + Explosive Trap**" | rotations.md Survival `[T]` | **Gap, report**: add opt-in Explosive Trap (combat traps are legal on 1.18.1). New ability = gated change; needs the exact Turtle spell name | Low — KnowsSpell-gated addition no-ops if absent; trap GCD economics need a dummy check vs Immolation |
| H3 | **Low-mana sting swap** | Sting choice is static config; only the ASPECT swaps at low mana (hysteresis) | "drop to **Viper Sting** / Aspect of the Viper at low mana" | rotations.md MM `[T]` | **User decision**: optional "auto-Viper-Sting below X% mana" mirroring the aspect hysteresis. Gated | Sting swap burns a GCD + debuff slot mid-fight; auto-swapping can churn slots near the 16-debuff cap |
| H4 | **README/code disagree on AoE order** | Code: Multi-Shot first, then Volley | README: "*Volley* leads then *Multi-Shot* fills"; rotations.md doesn't order them | README vs code — doc bug on one side | **Decide which is intended**: fixing README = ungated doc fix; reordering code = gated rotation change. (Multi-first is defensible: instant, then channel) | If Volley-first is the tuned intent, current code under-uses the channel on dense packs |
| H5 | **Lock and Load / Baited Shot / Kill Command names** | Implemented from proc-buff and spell names the research doc doesn't document (`Lock and Load`, `Baited Shot`, `Kill Command` on CD) | rotations.md MM says only "'Trueshot' renamed Steady Shot (first MM capstone)"; no L&L entry. README already flags these as best-effort | Code ahead of research — **[?]** | **Verify in-game** (`/sbr talents`, `/sbr debug`) and then document in rotations.md; wrong names are inert (KnowsSpell/HasBuff gates), so no rotation risk today | — (no-op if names wrong) |
| H6 | **Melee priority order** | Mongoose (reactive) → Lacerate → Raptor → Wing Clip | "Raptor Strike / Mongoose Bite with **Lacerate priority** → … → Wing Clip strict filler" — reads as Lacerate above the strikes | rotations.md Survival `[T]`, ordering phrasing ambiguous | **Dummy-verify [?]** whether Lacerate-before-Mongoose matters; Mongoose has a 5s reactive window so firing it first rarely costs a Lacerate tick | Swapping could waste Mongoose windows (they expire); current order is defensible — don't change on paper |
| H7 | **Wing Clip default** | `useWingClip = false` in every template | Wing Clip is the Survival "strict filler" (Phantom Strike procs on-swing effects) | rotations.md Survival `[T]` | **User decision**: template default only (existing profiles untouched). Mostly matters with Windfury Totem support | Wing Clip costs mana per filler press; solo/leveling it's waste — default-off is defensible |
| H8 | **Stinging Nettle Lacing not modeled** | Sting only applied at range; no awareness that talented Mongoose/fire traps apply reduced-duration Serpent | "Mongoose Bite + Fire traps apply your highest Serpent Sting at reduced duration" (2 pts) | rotations.md Survival `[T]` | **Note only**: melee hunters with the talent keep Serpent up implicitly; no code change needed unless sting bookkeeping starts double-counting (it keys off the debuff scan, so it self-corrects) | — |

### Match notes (checked, no discrepancy)

- Steady Shot weave is event-timed 1:1 after each Auto Shot with clip protection — exactly
  the `[T]` "Auto + Steady weave" model, more precisely than the research's `[?]`
  weapon-speed patterns (which stay unverified; don't implement on paper).
- Aimed Shot default = proc-only (never on CD) matches "often dropped / clips Auto" `[T]`.
- Survival is a real melee archetype in code (Wolf aspect, Raptor/Mongoose/Lacerate/Carve,
  Carve sharing Multi-Shot's CD comes free via the client's shared-CD IsReady). ✓
- Mark-before-sting strict opener matches the "Hunter's Mark pre-pull" note; sting is
  distance-gated so a melee hunter lands it on approach then stops. ✓
- Mana-aspect hysteresis (Viper at low, back at +15%) matches the mana-efficiency core. ✓
- Sting poison-immunity handling (Mechanical/Elemental type-block + learned per-target
  immunity) is beyond the research doc — keep.

## 3. SHAMAN (`classes/Class_Shaman.lua`)

### What the code does

Mode dispatch (enhancement / elemental / tank / restoration). **Enhancement**: melee swing
→ shield upkeep → Bloodlust (opt-in) → Stormstrike → Lightning Strike → chosen shock on the
shared CD (Flame Shock as maintained DoT) → totem upkeep (all four elements, one per press)
→ Lightning Bolt filler (default ON). **Elemental**: shield → Elemental Mastery on CD →
Flame Shock DoT upkeep (recast when the debuff drops; blind 12s timer without detection) or
chosen shock on CD → totems → Lightning Bolt filler. **Tank**: shield → Earthshaker Slam
taunt when the target isn't on you → Stormstrike → shock (Earth default) → Lightning Strike
→ totems → optional LB. **Restoration**: Mana Tide ≤25% mana → NS-equivalent → instant
max-rank Healing Wave (emergency ≤40%) → Lesser Healing Wave (≤50%, beats AoE) → Chain Heal
(≥3 hurt) → downranked Healing Wave → Water Shield → totems → optional LB damage weave.
Totem clocks are stamped by SuperWoW `UNIT_CASTEVENT` (manual drops reset the right slot)
with 55s water / 110s other redrop timers.

### Discrepancies

| # | Ability / order | What the code does | What research says | Source + confidence | Recommended action | RISK if changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Elemental: Molten Blast missing** | Flame Shock is maintained by **recasting Flame Shock** when its debuff drops; Molten Blast is nowhere in the module | Core Turtle loop: "apply Flame Shock → **maintain it by casting Molten Blast in the last ~3s of the DoT** (Rekindled Flame) → fill with Lightning Bolt" — this is THE Turtle Elemental mechanic | rotations.md + turtle-mechanics.md `[T]` | **Headline gap, report**: add Molten Blast (KnowsSpell-gated) with a "refresh window" check on Flame Shock's remaining time. Needs Flame Shock's exact Turtle duration + Molten Blast CD; gated change with dummy verification | Without exact durations the refresh window can miss and drop the DoT (worse than today's recast). Must be built with `/sbr debug` timings, not paper numbers |
| S2 | **Elemental: Chain Lightning missing** | No Chain Lightning anywhere (single LB filler) | "weave Chain Lightning only with haste/mana headroom (~3-4 LB : 1 CL)"; AoE = "spam Chain Lightning on 3+" | rotations.md `[T]` (ratio itself reads `[?]`-ish) | **Gap, report**: opt-in CL weave (mana-floor gated) + CL as the AoE spam. Gated | CL is mana-hungry; a bad ratio starves the mana pool — research itself calls Elemental bottom-tier, so headroom gating matters |
| S3 | **Shaman has no AoE mode** | No `aoeMode` in the shaman profile at all; Magma/Fire Nova exist only as fire-slot totem picks | "AoE/dungeon: **Fire Nova Totem → Magma Totem → spam Chain Lightning** on 3+" | rotations.md `[T]` | **Gap, report**: add `/sbr aoe` for shaman (swap fire-slot to Nova/Magma + CL spam), mirroring other classes' AoE toggles. Gated | Modest — AoE toggle is opt-in by design; totem swapping mid-fight churns GCDs |
| S4 | **Elemental: Earth Shock while moving** | Shock choice is static config (elemental template = flame); no movement awareness | "Earth Shock **while moving** or for a target dying before refresh" | rotations.md `[T]` | **Report**: Nampower's `PlayerIsMoving` (see docs/dependencies.md) makes this implementable; needs fork-availability check + gate | Depends on a Nampower API that must be confirmed on the live client first (`if PlayerIsMoving then`) |
| S5 | **Flame Shock snapshot timing** | DoT recast purely on "debuff missing" | "Flame Shock (**snapshots** — time with trinket/EM/Nightfall procs)" | rotations.md `[T]` claim, proc-timing value `[?]` | **Note only** for now: proc-window snapshotting is a polish-tier optimization; record in the backlog | High complexity, low payoff until Molten Blast (S1) exists |
| S6 | **Enhancement: LB filler default ON** | `lbFiller = true` in enhancement/starter templates — hardcasts LB between melee | Research Enhancement lists SS + LS + shocks + melee; no LB weave at endgame (casting stops swings) | rotations.md `[T]` silence vs code default | **User decision**: template default (leveling likes the filler; raid Enhancement probably wants it off). Existing profiles unaffected | Turning it off globally would gut low-level DPS where LB is the only button — keep it per-profile |
| S7 | **Weapon imbue upkeep missing (Windfury/Rockbiter)** | No imbue handling in any spec | Enhancement: "melee with **Windfury weapon**"; Tank: "**Rockbiter affects ALL threat**" | rotations.md + turtle-mechanics.md `[T]` | **Already roadmapped**: Phase 2 `GetWeaponEnchantID` detection helper, then a gated rotation hook. No action in Phase 1 | — |
| S8 | **Tank: Earth Shock vs Lightning Strike order** | Taunt → Stormstrike → shock → Lightning Strike | "Lightning Strike + Earth Shock for threat" (no explicit order); tank spec "in active dev" on Turtle | rotations.md `[T]`/dev-moving | **No change**: order unverifiable on paper; dummy/threat-meter test when the user plays tank | — |
| S9 | **Earthshaker Slam / NS-equivalent / totem names** | Best-effort names, KnowsSpell-gated, README flags them for in-game confirmation | Research doesn't document them | code ahead of research `[?]` | **Verify in-game** then backfill rotations.md; inert if wrong | — (no-op if names wrong) |

### Match notes (checked, no discrepancy)

- Elemental core shape (Flame Shock DoT + LB-as-Electrify-builder, Electrify never ramped
  explicitly) matches `[T]` — Electrify builds passively in code exactly as research says
  it should (no dedicated logic = correct).
- Elemental Mastery on CD when enabled ✓ (research: "on CD, weak").
- Stormstrike before shock (buff → consume) ✓; SS/LS as talent abilities auto-detected via
  KnowsSpell ✓.
- Restoration priority (Mana Tide → NS+HW → LHW emergency → Chain Heal ≥3 → downranked HW →
  Water Shield → totems) matches the `[V]` sketch; rank tables are flagged in-code as
  vanilla baselines pending the Phase 3 live tuning — consistent with research's own
  "needs `[?]` tuning".
- The cross-spec totem system with `UNIT_CASTEVENT` stamping is beyond research; Phase 2
  adds destruction detection. Redrop intervals (55s/110s) are already flagged in-code for
  Turtle-duration tuning. ✓
