# AutoRota — Talent Reference (Turtle WoW 1.18.1)

Authoritative talent-name dictionary, extracted in-game via `/ar talents`. These
are the exact `GetTalentInfo` strings for the 1.18.1 client. **Use these spellings
for any name-based talent detection** in the class modules.

## Scope — what this dictionary does and does not verify

- ✅ **Talent names** (passive/active talents in the three trees per class). Authoritative.
- ⚠️ **Does NOT verify proc BUFF names.** A talent and the aura it grants often differ
  (e.g. the talent *Nightfall* grants the buff *Shadow Trance*; the talent *Elemental Focus*
  grants the buff *Clearcasting*). Buff names the rotations watch for must still be confirmed
  with `/ar debug` while the buff is active.
- ⚠️ **Does NOT list trained/baseline abilities.** Abilities learned from a trainer
  (e.g. *Mongoose Bite*, *Raptor Strike*, *Steady Shot*, *Blade Flurry*) are not talents and
  will not appear here; their exact names are confirmed via the spellbook / `/ar debug`.
- **Paladin is included below**, sourced from an earlier in-game talent dump (a `/run`
  macro printing tab + name). Its two name-based constants are confirmed present.

## Verification status of the strings AutoRota currently keys off

| Module | Constant / check | String | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Shaman | `TALENT_CLEARCAST` | `"Elemental Focus"` | ✅ confirmed in this dump (Elemental) |
| Warlock | `TALENT_NIGHTFALL` | `"Nightfall"` | ✅ confirmed in this dump (Affliction) |
| Paladin | `TALENT_HOLY_MIGHT` | `"Vengeful Strikes"` | ✅ confirmed in Paladin dump (Retribution / tab 3) |
| Paladin | `TALENT_THREAT` | `"Righteous Strikes"` | ✅ confirmed in Paladin dump (Protection / tab 2) |

Talent-gated abilities detected via `KnowsSpell` were also cross-checked and all match:
*Carve, Lacerate, Kill Command* (Hunter); *Aimed Shot, Lock and Load* (Hunter MM);
*Noxious Assault, Envenom* (Rogue Assassination); *Riposte, Adrenaline Rush* (Rogue Combat);
*Death Wish* (Warrior Fury); *Sweeping Strikes* (Warrior Arms); *Bestial Wrath* (Hunter BM);
*Shadowburn* (Warlock Destruction); *Stormstrike, Bloodlust, Lightning Strike* (Shaman Enhancement);
*Elemental Mastery* (Shaman Elemental).

**Result: no code changes required — every name-based talent string in the modules is correct.**

Proc-buff names still pending an `/ar debug` confirm (almost certainly standard vanilla names,
but unproven by a talent dump): `Clearcasting` (Shaman, from Elemental Focus),
`Shadow Trance` (Warlock, from Nightfall), `Lock and Load` (Hunter buff aura).

## Paladin
Source: your earlier in-game `/run … GetTalentInfo` dump (tab 1 = Holy, tab 2 = Protection, tab 3 = Retribution).

> **Note:** The Paladin dump above came from a `/run` macro that prints tab + name only,
> so it lists the talent names without per-tree section headers from `/ar talents`.
> The tab→spec mapping (1 Holy, 2 Protection, 3 Retribution) is the standard Paladin order.
> The two name-based constants are confirmed present: `"Vengeful Strikes"` (Retribution)
> and `"Righteous Strikes"` (Protection).
