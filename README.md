# AutoRota (v0.7.2b)

AutoRota is a lightweight, robust, Configurable one-button rotation, multi class (Turtle WoW 1.12 / SuperWoW). Unlike standard "monolithic" 1.12 macros or basic script loops, AutoRota uses a modern modular architecture, automated frame-by-frame management, and smart situational logic to execute combat rotations.

Version 0.4 introduces a complete graphical configuration panel and database system, moving configuration options out of your macros and into a clean visual window.

## 🖥️ Features

- **Multi-Class Architecture:** A unified, lightweight UI shell dynamically swaps control panels and rotation rules based on the class you are currently playing.
- **Smart Profile Management:** Create, save, rename, and activate multiple custom setup profiles (e.g., *Starter*, *Leveling*, *PvP*, *Raid-DPS*) seamlessly in-game.
- **Turtle WoW & SuperWoW Optimized:** Fully compatible with custom SuperWoW features such as spell queueing (`QueueSpellByName`), weapon swing timing, and custom custom class expansions (e.g., Rogue's *Noxious Assault*, Paladin's *Holy Strike*).
- **Exact Debuff Detection:** Target debuffs are resolved to their precise spell name via SuperWoW spell ids (built once per press in the core), so upkeep is rank- and locale-proof for every class. Clients without SuperWoW fall back automatically to icon-texture matching.
- **Zero-Clipping Logic:** Rotations run on strict single-cast priorities with early returns. The addon ensures exactly one primary action executes per frame to prevent spell clipping or overlapping global cooldowns (GCD).
- **Lightweight Per-Press Cost:** Spellbook lookups, profile validity, the auto-attack button, player buffs, and target debuffs are all cached or snapshotted (and refreshed automatically when you learn spells or edit profiles), so spamming the macro costs a handful of table reads instead of repeated full spellbook, action-bar, buff, and debuff scans.
- **Minimap Button:** A draggable minimap button opens the configuration panel with a click (right-click runs the rotation once). Hide or show it with `/armap`.

## ⚠️ Included Class Modules (WiP)

### 🛡️ Paladin `(Beta)`
Engineered around an intelligent "Roleless Seal Model" optimized for low-level leveling up to high-tier raiding:
- **Debuff Upkeep:** Automatically tracks target judgement debuffs by exact spell name (SuperWoW spell ids, with texture fallback). Applies your chosen *Debuff Seal* (e.g., *Seal of the Crusader* or *Seal of Wisdom*) exactly once per mob, then switches immediately to your *Damage Seal*.
- **Low-Level Safety Guard:** Built-in safeguards automatically bypass the Judgement/Debuff loop if your Paladin is under level 10 and hasn't learned `Judgement` yet, keeping your damage seal active as a permanent auto-attack buff.
- **Hysteresis Resource Management:** Fully configurable independent health and mana safety floors. When triggered, the engine swaps to *Seal of Light* or *Seal of Wisdom* until your resource stabilizes back to your high threshold.
- **Seal Twisting Support:** If enabled, delays damage judgements until precisely `< 0.4s` before your next white swing to combine weapon procs and judgements simultaneously.
- **Talent & Weapon Aware Strikes:** A single *Strike mode* picks how *Holy Strike* and *Crusader Strike* are used — `Off`, `Auto (talent/weapon)`, `Crusader Strike`, `Holy Strike`, or `Holy then Crusader`. **Auto** reads your spec and gear: *Holy Might* is maintained only if you have *Vengeful Strike*, and the Holy-vs-Crusader lean follows *Righteous Strike* or a shield/offhand (threat lean) versus a two-hander (Crusader lean), adjusting live as you swap weapons. *Zeal* is built and kept rolling in every mode.
- **Mana Downranking (opt-in):** *Downrank when low* casts lower ranks of your strikes as raw mana drops, to keep swinging while leveling. Thresholds use absolute mana (not percent), so a full pool stays at top rank and only a near-empty pool steps down, always clamped to your highest known rank.
- **Consecration (opt-in):** An AoE filler cast on cooldown when enabled. Because the 1.12 client cannot reliably count nearby enemies, it is a manual toggle — the *Consecration (AoE)* checkbox, or `/ar aoe` for a quick keybind flip. It sits last in the priority so it never delays your strikes, *Holy Shield*, seal/Judgement upkeep, or *Hammer of Wrath*, and is held during mana recovery.
- **Exorcism (opt-in):** Cast on cooldown, but only against *Undead* and *Demon* targets (checked via creature type), and likewise paused while recovering mana.

### 🥷 Rogue `(Beta)`
A refined evolution of the *ExAutoRogue* logic focused on efficient combo point generation and finishing priority:
- **Adaptive Combo Builders:** Automatically chooses your highest efficiency spec builder (*Noxious Assault* if known, falling back to *Sinister Strike*), or allows you to force a fixed weapon builder via a profile dropdown.
- **Finisher Hysteresis Engine:** Dynamically tracks *Slice and Dice* and *Envenom* buffs. It will auto-refresh them efficiently at exactly 1 Combo Point if they are about to expire, otherwise saving points to dump into maximum-damage *Eviscerates*.
- **Reactionary Counters:** Instantaneous out-of-GCD execution for abilities like *Riposte* during active parry windows.
- **Cooldown Automation:** Integrates *Adrenaline Rush* and *Blade Flurry* seamlessly, prioritizing them against Elite or Boss targets.

### ⚔️ Warrior `(Beta)`
A roleless, toggle-driven engine covering Arms, Fury, and Protection from early leveling through endgame raiding. Rather than locking to a spec, you enable the abilities you have and the priority degrades gracefully as you learn them:
- **All-Spec Roleless Design:** One profile schema serves every spec via simple toggles. Abilities you have not learned yet are skipped automatically and flagged as *(not learned)* in the panel, so the same setup keeps working as you level.
- **Stance & Rage Aware Casting:** A warrior-specific gate verifies rage, stance, and cooldown *before* committing to a cast, so a stance- or rage-locked ability can never stall the priority chain. Stance rules follow vanilla 1.12 and stay conservative if Turtle relaxes them.
- **Reactive Proc Windows:** Reads the combat log for target dodges and your own block/dodge/parry to open short windows for *Overpower* (Battle Stance) and *Revenge* (Defensive Stance), mirroring the Rogue's Riposte tracker.
- **Optional Stance Dancing:** An experimental opt-in that auto-swaps to Battle Stance for *Overpower*, then drifts back to your configured home stance, throttled by a swap cooldown to prevent thrashing.
- **Smart Rage Dump:** Queues *Heroic Strike* (or *Cleave* in AoE mode) onto your next swing only above a configurable rage floor, and suppresses it during the *Execute* phase so surplus rage funnels into *Execute*.
- **Cooldown Automation:** *Death Wish*, *Recklessness*, and *Berserker Rage* fire on cooldown, only on Elite/Boss targets, or fully manually — the same three-state model as the other classes — while *Bloodrage* tops up rage on demand, even before the pull.
- **Threat Toolkit:** Maintains *Sunder Armor* up to a chosen stack count and weaves *Shield Slam*, *Revenge*, and *Shield Block* upkeep for Protection tanking.

### 🔮 Warlock `(Beta)`

Optimized for efficient DoT upkeep and resource management:

* **DoT Priority Engine:** Keeps your enabled damage-over-time effects up in strict priority — *Immolate*, then your chosen Curse, then *Corruption*, then *Siphon Life* — detected by exact spell name (SuperWoW spell ids, with texture fallback), with a per-target landing memory so cast-time DoTs are never double-queued while still in the air. Every curse is now tracked precisely, not just the ones with a hand-verified icon.
* **Curse Selection:** One curse per target, switchable from the panel or mid-fight with `/ar curse <alias>` (`coa`, `coe`, `cos`, `cow`, `cor`, `cot`, `cod`, `none`).
* **Life Tap Integration:** Hysteresis-style management that triggers *Life Tap* only when mana dips below your threshold **and** health is safely above your floor.
* **Configurable Filler:** When every enabled DoT is up — wand (mana-free), *Shadow Bolt*, or *Drain Life*. A *Nightfall* option fires the free instant *Shadow Bolt* the moment *Shadow Trance* procs.
* **Cast Queueing & Pet Support:** Cast-time spells use SuperWoW's `QueueSpellByName` so the rotation never clips a cast (with a smart exception while wanding, where a direct cast fires immediately). Optionally sends your pet onto the target every press.

### 🐾 Druid `(Beta)`

Cat (DPS), Bear (Tank), and Balance (Caster/Moonkin) in one form-adaptive engine — working from level 1:

* **Form-Adaptive Rotation:** Each press follows the form you are actually in — Cat Form runs the DPS rotation, Bear/Dire Bear runs the tank rotation, Moonkin (or a *Caster/Moonkin* preference) runs the Balance rotation, and caster form shifts you into your profile's preferred form (panel dropdown or `/ar form cat|bear|caster`). One profile, one macro, every job.
* **Level 1 and Up:** Before any combat form is learned (Bear at 10, Cat at 20), the caster rotation carries the character — Moonfire upkeep plus Wrath is exactly the right early-leveling loop — and the profile grows into its form automatically the moment it is trained.
* **Balance / Eclipse Weaving:** Keeps *Moonfire* and *Insect Swarm* up, then chain-casts your primary nuke (Wrath or Starfire) to fish for **Eclipse** procs and swaps to the empowered opposite nuke the instant one fires. Nukes are queued through SuperWoW, so spamming never clips a cast — the press during your current cast lines up the buffed spell for the moment the proc window opens. Entering Moonkin (when learned) is automatic for the mana discount.
* **Defensive Bear (HP Management):** Optional hysteresis safety net, same design as the Paladin's resource sliders — drop below your low threshold (default 35%) and the rotation forces Bear Form from **any** form, fires *Frenzied Regeneration* on cooldown, and keeps tanking the mob down behind bear armor; climb back over your high threshold (default 70%) and it releases you to your preferred form automatically. Off by default and inert until Bear Form is learned.
* **Two Turtle Cat Styles:** *Claw & Bleed* keeps *Rake* and *Rip* rolling and builds with *Claw* (pairs with bleed-energy talents like *Ancient Brutality*); *Shred & Powershift* builds with *Shred* and finishes with *Ferocious Bite* for bleed-immune bosses (MC/BWL). Swap mid-fight with `/ar style bleed|shred`.
* **Smart Finishers:** At your combo threshold the bleed style applies *Rip* if it is not ticking and spends *Ferocious Bite* while it is — combo points are never dumped into a redundant bleed.
* **Powershifting (opt-in):** In the Shred style, when energy bottoms out below your slider the rotation shifts to caster and straight back into Cat for a fresh energy bar — and **never while Tiger's Fury is active**, so the buff is not thrown away.
* **Stealth Opener & Upkeep:** Opens from *Prowl* with *Ravage* (auto, if known) or *Pounce*, and keeps *Faerie Fire (Feral)* and *Tiger's Fury* running.
* **Bear Tanking:** *Faerie Fire (Feral)* as the **ranged opener** (instant, 30yd — starts threat + damage on the pull before the mob reaches you), optional **Growl** taunt that grabs threat on the pull and whenever the target stops attacking you (off when you already hold aggro, so solo play never wastes it), *Demoralizing Roar* upkeep, *Maul* as the rage dump, *Swipe* leading under `/ar aoe`, and optional *Enrage* when rage-starved (in combat only — it lowers armor, so it is off by default). *(Moonfire cannot be cast in bear form, so Faerie Fire is the bear's ranged opener.)*
* **Form-Aware Auto-Attack:** The white swing is started automatically in **Cat and Bear** (and never while casting in caster/Moonkin). Note: for this to work in a form, the **Attack** ability must sit on an action-bar slot that the form bar does *not* replace (e.g. a side or bottom bar), or let *SuperCleveRoidMacros* handle attacks.

### 🏹 Hunter `(Beta)`

Reworked for Turtle WoW 1.18.1's hunter changes, with a **Ranged** and a **Melee** playstyle selectable per profile (`/ar mode ranged|melee`):

* **Ranged (BM / MM):** Built around the **Auto Shot** backbone with **Steady Shot** (baseline at 20) as the 1:1 weave after each shot, and *Arcane Shot* / *Multi-Shot* weaved as instants. Auto Shot is kept *running* (toggle-safe: detected via `IsAutoRepeatAction`, with an assumed-on safeguard per target so it is never toggled off). Shots are queued through SuperWoW/Nampower so the weave never clips the shot in progress.
* **Lock and Load (MM capstone):** *Aimed Shot* is **not** hard-cast on cooldown (that clips Auto Shot). Instead the rotation watches for the **Lock and Load** buff — a crit from Steady/Aimed/Arcane that resets Aimed Shot, drops its cast time, and makes it cleave a line — and fires *Aimed Shot* the instant it procs. A toggle lets you also cast it on cooldown if you prefer.
* **Melee (Survival / BM-melee):** Keeps **Aspect of the Wolf** up, starts melee swings, uses **Raptor Strike** on cooldown and **Mongoose Bite** reactively in the window after you dodge, with optional *Wing Clip*. Survival can drop **Immolation Trap** on cooldown (Patch 1.18.1 allows traps in combat).
* **One Sting Slot:** *Serpent*, *Scorpid*, or *Viper* (or none), from the panel or `/ar sting serpent|scorpid|viper|none`. Stings and *Hunter's Mark* are applied once per target and refreshed exactly when they fall off (SuperWoW spell-id detection).
* **Aspect Management:** Keeps your combat aspect (Hawk ranged / Wolf melee) up, and can **swap to the mana-regenerating aspect** below a mana threshold, swapping back once recovered (hysteresis so it never flaps).
* **Pet Support:** Pet attack, *Mend Pet* below a health slider, **Kill Command** on cooldown (BM), and an optional **Baited Shot** fired in the window after the pet crits.
* **AoE & Cooldowns:** *Volley* leads then *Multi-Shot* fills under `/ar aoe`. *Rapid Fire* and *Bestial Wrath* automate on the usual three-state model — always, elite/boss only, or off.

> **Verification note:** A few 1.18.1 specifics are best-effort and gated by `KnowsSpell`, so an unknown name simply no-ops. If *Kill Command*, *Baited Shot*, the **Lock and Load** buff, or the mana aspect (tried: *Aspect of the Viper*, *Aspect of the Beast*) are not firing, run `/ar debug` and check the exact names — they drop into one place in `Class_Hunter.lua`.

## Commands & Usage

AutoRota is designed to be mapped directly to a spammable macro on your action bar.

### The Combat Macro

## ⚔️ The Ultimate Combat Macro
Because all configuration logic is handled by the visual interface and database, your in-game macro is now completely streamlined down to a single line:
```macro
/ar
```

> #### 🗡️ Melee classes: put **Attack** on an action bar
> For melee classes (Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, and Druid in Cat/Bear form), AutoRota keeps your white swing going by toggling the standard **Attack** ability — but it can only do this if that ability is on one of your action bars. Open your spellbook (**P**), find **Attack** in the *General* tab, and drag it onto any free action slot. Without it, the rotation will fire abilities but you may notice you are not auto-attacking between them.
>
> **Druids, read this:** shapeshifting into Cat or Bear form **replaces your main action bar** with the form bar, so **Attack** must sit on a bar that stays visible while shifted — the right-side vertical bars or the bottom-right bar, **not** the main bar (slots 1–12). If it is only on the main bar, you will see the rotation taunt and use abilities but the white swing will not start in form.
>
> *Exception:* if you run **SuperCleveRoidMacros**, AutoRota leaves auto-attack handling to SCRM and skips this step.

> #### 🏹 Hunter: put **Auto Shot** on an action bar
> AutoRota keeps your **Auto Shot** firing between instants. It detects the shot most reliably when **Auto Shot** is on one of your action bars, so drag it there from your spellbook (**P** → *General* tab). If you enable the **melee weave** option, also place **Attack** on a bar so *Raptor Strike* has white swings to ride.

### Paladin Seal Aliases
When using the /ar seal command, you can use short aliases:

  * `sotc` / `crusader` → `Seal of the Crusader`
  * `sor` / `righteousness` → `Seal of Righteousness`
  * `soc` / `command` → `Seal of Command`
  * `sow` / `wisdom` → `Seal of Wisdom`

# Combat Utility Macros:

## Paladin Combat Toggles:

You can maintain a single spammable combat macro while using separate keybinds to hot-swap seals during an encounter:

  * `/ar seal <profile> debuff <alias>` : Updates your current rotation debuff mid-fight.

  * `/ar seal <profile> damage <alias>` : Updates your current rotation damage seal mid-fight.

  * `/ar strike <mode>` : Switches strike mode on the active profile mid-fight — `off`, `auto`, `cs`, `hs`, or `hscs` (Holy then Crusader). Handy for binding a tank/leveling style to a key.

## Warrior Combat Toggles:

The Warrior module adds quick toggles you can bind to separate keys to adjust the rotation mid-fight without opening the panel:

  * `/ar aoe` : Toggles AoE mode (rage dump becomes *Cleave*, *Whirlwind* used on cooldown).

  * `/ar cd on|elite|off` : Sets cooldown usage to always, Elite/Boss only, or fully manual.

  * `/ar dance` : Toggles experimental stance dancing for *Overpower*.

  * `/ar spell <alias> on|off` : Flips an individual ability on the active profile (e.g., `/ar spell bt off`).

### Warrior Spell Aliases
When using the /ar spell command, you can use short aliases:

  * `ms` / `mortalstrike` → `Mortal Strike`
  * `bt` / `bloodthirst` → `Bloodthirst`

  * `sa` / `sunder` → `Sunder Armor`, `tc` / `thunderclap` → `Thunder Clap`
  * `hs` / `heroicstrike` → `Heroic Strike`, `cleave` → `Cleave`, `sweep` / `sweeping` → `Sweeping Strikes`
  * `dw` / `deathwish` → `Death Wish`, `reck` / `recklessness` → `Recklessness`, `br` / `berserkerrage` → `Berserker Rage`
  * `bld` / `bloodrage` → `Bloodrage`, `sb` / `shieldblock` → `Shield Block`

## Hunter Combat Toggles:

The Hunter module adds quick toggles you can bind to separate keys to adjust the rotation mid-fight without opening the panel:

  * `/ar mode ranged|melee` : Switches the hunter playstyle (BM/MM ranged vs Survival/BM melee).

  * `/ar sting serpent|scorpid|viper|none` : Switches the maintained sting on the active profile.

  * `/ar aoe` : Toggles AoE mode (*Volley* leads, then *Multi-Shot* fills).

  * `/ar cd on|elite|off` : Sets cooldown usage (*Rapid Fire*, *Bestial Wrath*) to always, Elite/Boss only, or fully manual.

  * `/ar spell <alias> on|off` : Flips an individual ability on the active profile (e.g., `/ar spell aimed on`).

### Hunter Spell Aliases

## 🚩 Troubleshooting & False Positives
MacroErrorChecker / UI Warning Messages
If you use macro validation addons like MacroErrorChecker, you may see a warning in chat on login stating: L3: Unknown command: /ar.

This is a false positive. External macro checkers look for a static list of default Blizzard interface commands. They cannot scan third-party custom slash engines. As long as typing /ar ui opens your addon profile window, AutoRota is working perfectly and you can safely ignore or disable the validation warning. This can be added to the whitelist with some addons like `SuperCleveRoidMacros` to avoid the chat error.

### My character casts abilities but doesn't auto-attack
On a melee class, AutoRota starts your white swing by toggling the standard **Attack** ability, which it locates by scanning your action bars. If **Attack** is not on any bar, there is nothing for it to toggle and you will fire abilities without swinging in between. Drag **Attack** from your spellbook (**P** → *General* tab) onto any action slot. (If you use **SuperCleveRoidMacros**, it manages attacks instead and AutoRota leaves this alone.)
