-- ============================================================
-- Class_Hunter  -  hunter module for Aegis_SBR
-- Turtle WoW 1.18.1 (SuperWoW). Reworked for Turtle's hunter changes.
-- ============================================================
-- Turtle 1.18.1 reshaped the hunter heavily, so this module is built around
-- the live playstyles rather than vanilla:
--  * RANGED (BM / MM): Auto Shot is the damage backbone. Steady Shot (now
--    baseline at 20) weaves 1:1 after each Auto Shot - it is gated on the exact
--    Auto Shot timing from SuperWoW's UNIT_CASTEVENT (with an interval fallback)
--    so mashing it cannot chain casts and starve Auto Shot - with Arcane Shot and
--    Multi-Shot weaved as instants. Aimed Shot is NOT pressed on cooldown
--    (it clips Auto Shot) - it is only fired when the Marksmanship capstone
--    "Lock and Load" procs (crit from Steady/Aimed/Arcane resets Aimed Shot,
--    drops its cast time, and makes it cleave a line), or optionally on
--    cooldown if you turn the proc-only guard off.
--  * MELEE (Survival / BM-melee): Aspect of the Wolf, melee auto-attack,
--    Raptor Strike on cooldown, Mongoose Bite reactively after you dodge,
--    optional Wing Clip. Survival can also drop Immolation Trap on cooldown
--    in combat (a 1.18.1 change) and weave shots.
--  * Mana aspect swap: at a low-mana threshold the rotation swaps to the
--    mana-regenerating aspect, then back to the combat aspect once recovered
--    (hysteresis, so it does not flap at the boundary).
--  * Pet: attack, Mend Pet when hurt, Kill Command on cooldown (BM), and an
--    optional Baited Shot reaction when the pet crits.
-- Exact spell strings are gated by KnowsSpell, so an ability the character or
-- the server does not have simply no-ops instead of breaking the chain.
